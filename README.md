## How to use?

You need to install some packages that are dependencies for everything to work.
Do this preferably on some [**tty**](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-switch-tty)

[**Want to use Arch? Use my install script**](https://github.com/mamutal91/myarch)

```
$ sudo pacman -Sy git --noconfirm
$ git clone https://github.com/mariorodrigues10/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ cp -r dotfiles/<folder> ~/.config/
```
